abstract ={Motivation: A major problem for current peak detection algorithms is that noise in mass spectrometry (MS) spectra gives rise to a high rate of false positives. The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods.Results: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, ?true? peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a ?goodness of fit? coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the 2D CWT coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with SELDI-TOF spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the CWT-based algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low.Availability: The algorithm is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the Bioconductor project.Contact:s-lin2@northwestern.eduSupplementary material:http://basic.northwestern.edu/publications/peakdetection/.

Despite decades of research, it has proved frustratingly difficult to establish climatically meaningful relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation. As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations.},

This presentation outlines the suite of algorithms used to progress from moment data to model-like three-dimensional geophysical parameters, including quantitative precipitation and three dimensional storm dynamics. Taking advantage of the recent MC3E field program, analysis has focused primarily on the Southern Great Plains radar network. However, in addition, some results from Manus Island in the tropical western Pacific and Barrow on the north slope of Alaska will be presented. As retrievals from these systems will be used to improve the cloud and climate models, a particular emphasis will be placed on verification of the retrievals with independent measurements.},

	abstract = {The tropical marine PBL under the influence of a deep convection system is investigated using a large-domain LES that resolves a wide range of scales, from mesoscale cloud clusters down to energy-containing turbulence. The simulated PBL is dominated by both turbulence and cloud-induced cold-pools. The variance of vertical velocity in the PBL resides mostly in the turbulence scales while that of water vapor mixing ratio resides mostly at the cold-pool scales; however, both turbulence and cold-pool scales contribute about equally to their covariance. The broad scale range of the LES flow field is decomposed into the filtered (i.e., cloud system) and the subfilter (i.e., small convection and turbulence) components using a Gaussian filter with various filter widths. Such decomposed flow fields are used to retrieve information of spatial distribution of the subfilter-scale fluxes and their relationship to the filtered field. This information is then used to evaluate the performance of an eddy-viscosity model commonly used in cloud-resolving models. The subfilter-scale fluxes computed from the eddy-viscosity model correlate reasonably with those retrieved from the LES in the lower cloud layer but not in the PBL; the correlation coefficients between the modeled and the retrieved fluxes are about 0.5 in the lower cloud layer but smaller than 0.2 in the PBL.},

In situ data were obtained from an aircraft which flew near a steerable dual-polarisation Doppler radar. The observations were obtained to characterise the microphysical properties of cold frontal clouds, with an emphasis on ice and precipitation formation and development. Primary ice nucleation near cloud top (âˆ’55Â°C) appeared to be enhanced by convective features. However, ice multiplication led to the largest ice particle number concentrations being observed at relatively high temperatures ({\textgreater} âˆ’10Â°C). The multiplication process (most likely rime splintering) occurs when stratiform precipitation interacts with supercooled water generated in the NCFR. Graupel was notably absent in the data obtained. Ice multiplication processes are known to have a strong impact in glaciating isolated convective clouds, but have rarely been studied within larger organised convective systems such as NCFRs. Secondary ice particles will impact on precipitation formation and cloud dynamics due to their relatively small size and high number density. Further modelling studies are required to quantify the effects of rime splintering on precipitation and dynamics in frontal rainbands. Available parametrizations used to diagnose the particle size distributions do not account for the influence of ice multiplication. This deficiency in parametrizations is likely to be important in some cases for modelling the evolution of cloud systems and the precipitation formation. Ice multiplication has significant impact on artefact removal from in situ particle imaging probes.},

	abstract = {Aerosols serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and thus have a substantial effect on cloud properties and the initiation of precipitation. Large concentrations of human-made aerosols have been reported to both decrease and increase rainfall as a result of their radiative and CCN activities. At one extreme, pristine tropical clouds with low CCN concentrations rain out too quickly to mature into long-lived clouds. On the other hand, heavily polluted clouds evaporate much of their water before precipitation can occur, if they can form at all given the reduced surface heating resulting from the aerosol haze layer. We propose a conceptual model that explains this apparent dichotomy.},

Both range?height indicator data and vertical-pointing X-band data from the Taiwan Experimental Atmospheric Mobile-Radar (TEAM-R) are presented. Some of the given X-band data are biased, which is very likely caused by cross coupling of the H and V transmitted waves as a result of aligned, canted ice crystals. Modeled SHV data are used to explain the observed polarimetric signatures. Coincident data from the National Center for Atmospheric Research S-band polarimetric radar (S-Pol) are presented to augment and support the X-band polarimetric observations and interpretations. The polarimetric S-Pol data are obtained via fast-alternating transmission of horizontal and vertical polarizations (FHV), and thus the S-band data are not contaminated by the cross coupling (except the linear depolarization ratio LDR) observed in the X-band data. The radar data reveal that there are regions in the ice phase where electric fields are apparently aligning ice crystals near vertically and thus causing negative specific differential phase Kdp. The vertical-pointing data also indicate the presence of preferentially aligned ice crystals that cause differential reflectivity Zdr and differential phase ?dp to be strong functions of azimuth angle.},

	abstract = {All estimates of aerosol indirect effects on the global energy balance have either completely neglected the influence of aerosol on convective clouds or treated the influence in a highly parameterized manner. Embedding cloud-resolving models (CRMs) within each grid cell of a global model provides a multiscale modeling framework for treating both the influence of aerosols on convective as well as stratiform clouds and the influence of clouds on the aerosol, but treating the interactions explicitly by simulating all aerosol processes in the CRM is computationally prohibitive. An alternate approach is to use horizontal statistics (e.g., cloud mass flux, cloud fraction, and precipitation) from the CRM simulation to drive a single-column parameterization of cloud effects on the aerosol and then use the aerosol profile to simulate aerosol effects on clouds within the CRM. Here, we present results from the first component of the Explicit-Cloud Parameterized-Pollutant parameterization to be developed, which handles vertical transport of tracers by clouds. A CRM with explicit tracer transport serves as a benchmark. We show that this parameterization, driven by the CRM's cloud mass fluxes, reproduces the CRM tracer transport significantly better than a single-column model that uses a conventional convective cloud parameterization.},

	abstract = {CapsuleWe present an open, community-based virtual machine in which different Open Source Software tools are available for weather radar data processing and analysis., AbstractIn a recent BAMS article, it is argued that community-based Open Source Software (OSS) could foster scientific progress in weather radar research, and make weather radar software more affordable, flexible, transparent, sustainable, and interoperable.Nevertheless, it can be challenging for potential developers and users to realize these benefits: tools are often cumbersome to install; different operating systems may have particular issues, or may not be supported at all; and many tools have steep learning curves.In order to overcome some of these barriers, we present an open, community-based virtual machine (VM). This VM can be run on any operating system, and guarantees reproducibility of results across platforms. It contains a suite of independent OSS weather radar tools (BALTRAD, Py-ART, wradlib, RSL, and Radx), and a scientific Python stack. Furthermore, it features a suite of recipes that work out of the box, and provide guidance on how to use the different OSS tools alone and together. The code to build the VM from source is hosted on GitHub, which allows the VM to grow with its community.We argue that the VM presents another step towards Open (Weather Radar) Science. It can be used as a quick way to get started, for teaching, or for benchmarking and combining different tools. It can foster the idea of reproducible research in scientific publishing. Being scalable and extendable, it might even allow for real-time data processing.We expect the VM to catalyze progress towards interoperability, and to lower the barrier for new users and developers, thus extending the weather radar community and user base.},

	abstract = {AbstractDuring the late afternoon on 16 November 2008 the Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) suburb of ?The Gap? experienced extensive wind damage caused by an intense local thunderstorm. The CP2 research radar nearby detected near-surface radial velocities exceeding 43 m s?1 above The Gap while hail size reports did not exceed golf ball size, and no tornadoes were reported. The storm environment was characterized by a layer of very moist near-surface air and strong storm-relative low-level flow, whereas the storm-relative winds aloft were weak. While the thermodynamic storm environment contained a range of downdraft-promoting ingredients such as a {\textbackslash}textasciitilde4-km-high melting level above a {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2-km-deep layer with nearly dry-adiabatic lapse rates mostly collocated with dry ambient air, a {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1-km-deep stable layer near the ground would generally lower expectations of destructive surface winds based on the downburst mechanism. Once observed reflectivities exceed 70 dBZ, downdraft cooling due to hail melting and downdraft acceleration based on hail loading are found to likely become nonnegligible forcing mechanisms. The event featured the close proximity of a hydrostatically and dynamically driven mesohigh at the base of the downdraft to a dynamically driven mesolow associated with a low-level circulation. This proximity was instrumental in the anisotropic horizontal acceleration of the near-ground outflow and the ultimate strength of the Gap storm surface winds. Weak storm-relative midlevel winds are speculated to have allowed the downdraft to descend close to the low-level circulation, which set up this strong horizontal perturbation pressure gradient.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe potential utilization of specific attenuation A for rainfall estimation, mitigation of partial beam blockage, and radar networking is investigated. The R(A) relation is less susceptible to the variability of drop size distributions than traditional rainfall algorithms based on radar reflectivity Z, differential reflectivity ZDR, and specific differential phase KDP in a wide range of rain intensity. Specific attenuation is estimated from the radial profile of the measured Z and the total span of the differential phase using the ZPHI method. Since the estimated A is immune to reflectivity biases caused by radar miscalibration, attenuation, partial beam blockage, and wet radomes, rain retrieval from R(A) is also immune to the listed factors. The R(A) method was tested at X band using data collected by closely located radars in Germany and at S band for polarimetrically upgraded Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars in the United States.It is demonstrated that the two adjacent X-band radarsâ€”one of which is miscalibrated and another which is affected by partial beam blockageâ€”produce almost indistinguishable fields of rain rate. It is also shown that the R(A) method yields robust estimates of rain rates and rain totals at S band, where specific attenuation is vanishingly small. The X- and S-band estimates of rainfall obtained from R(A) are in good agreement with gauges.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms through which atmospheric aerosols affect cloud microphysics, dynamics and precipitation are investigated using a spectral microphysics two-dimensional cloud model. A significant effect of aerosols on cloud microphysics and dynamics has been found. Maritime aerosols lead to a rapid formation of raindrops that fall down through cloud updraughts increasing the loading in the lower part of a cloud. This is, supposedly, one of the reasons for comparatively low updraughts in maritime convective clouds. An increase in the concentration of small cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) leads to the formation of a large number of small droplets with a low collision rate, resulting in a time delay of raindrop formation. Such a delay prevents a decrease in the vertical velocity caused by the falling raindrops and thus increases the duration of the diffusion droplet growth stage, increasing latent heat release by condensation. The additional water that rises to the freezing level increases latent heat release by freezing. As a result, clouds developing in continental-type aerosol tend to have larger vertical velocities and to attain higher levels.The results show that a decrease in precipitation efficiency of single cumulus clouds arising in micro-physically continental air is attributable to a greater loss of the precipitating mass due to a greater sublimation of ice and evaporation of drops while they are falling from higher levels through a deep layer of dry air outside cloud updraughts. By affecting precipitation, atmospheric aerosols influence the net heating of the atmosphere. Simulations show that aerosols also change the vertical distribution of latent heat release, increasing the level of the heating peak.Clouds arising under continental aerosol conditions produce as a rule stronger downdraughts and stronger convergence in the boundary layer. Being triggered by larger dynamical forcing, secondary clouds arising in microphysically continental air are stronger and can, according to the results of simulations, form a squall line. The squall line formation was simulated both under maritime (GATE-74) and continental (PRE-STORM) thermodynamic conditions. In the maritime aerosol cases, clouds developing under similar thermodynamic conditions do not produce strong downdraughts and do not lead to squall line formation.Thus, the â€˜aerosol effectâ€™ on precipitation can be understood only in combination with the â€˜dynamical effectâ€™ of aerosols. Simulations allow us to suggest that aerosols, which decrease the precipitation efficiency of most single clouds, can contribute to the formation of very intensive convective clouds and thunderstorms (e.g. squall lines, etc.) accompanied by very high precipitation rates. Affecting precipitation, net atmospheric heating and its vertical distribution, as well as cloud depth and cloud coverage, atmospheric aerosols (including anthropogenic ones) influence atmospheric motions and radiation balance at different scales, from convective to, possibly, global ones.

	url = {https://ams.confex.com/ams/36Radar/webprogram/Paper228987.html},
	abstract = {Weather observations are conventionally performed by single polarization C-band weather radars with a temporal and spatial resolution of 5 min and 1 Km, respectively. However, for urbanized areas, these spatial and temporal resolutions may not be sufficient to detect, monitor, and obtain accurate rainfall rate estimates of fast-evolving weather phenomena. It is also known that, due to the high percentage of imperviousness and low rate of vegetation interception, the reaction of urban drainage catchments to a storm event is much faster than rural ones. Due to land use characteristics of urban areas and also to the small scale of urban catchments (i.e., few hectares up to few square kilometers), it is not uncommon that the time lag between rainfall and runoff peaks is of the order of few minutes. Therefore, to describe fast runoff processes and short response times, urban hydrological modelling requires high resolution rainfall data. In this work, a S-band vertical profiler (TARA) and a X-band horizontal scanner polarimetric weather radars (IDRA) are used to characterize physical processes and obtain accurate rainfall rate estimates of severe thunderstorms at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, the impact of deep convection; i.e., high rainfall rates, over urban areas, will be addressed to analyse the hydrological response time of urban drainage systems. A small-scale convective storm case from January 03rd 2012 was observed by both, IDRA and TARA from the Dutch national meteorological observatory CESAR. It is expected the new insights will be revealed based on the polarimetric and the high-resolution capabilities from both radars. Rainfall rate estimates obtained from IDRA and the C-band operational KNMI radar at elevation scan of 0.50 will be used to analyse urban hydrological response times under different resolutions of rainfall input (from 1 min temporal and 30 m spatial resolutions to upscale 5 min and 1 km) and different hydrodynamic model settings for the rainfall-runoff process, in a highly impervious urban drainage system belonging to Rotterdam urban area.},

The results of polarimetric echo classification have been integrated into the study to investigate the performance of radar rainfall estimation contingent on hydrometeor type. A new method for rainfall estimation that capitalizes on the results of polarimetric echo classification (EC method) is suggested. According to the EC method, polarimetric rainfall relations are utilized if the radar resolution volume is filled with rain (or rain and hail), and multiple R(Z) relations are used for different types of frozen hydrometeors. The intercept parameters in the R(Z) relations for each class are determined empirically from comparisons with gauges. It is shown that the EC method exhibits better performance than the conventional WSR-88D algorithm with a reduction by a factor of 1.5?2 in the rms error of 1-h rainfall estimates up to distances of 150 km from the radar. }

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright Â© 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

It is essential that these fine scale models be constrained by observations of the real atmosphere. However, due to the stochastic nature of convective systems simple one-to-one comparisons are not often possible. To this end a series of observational targets for fine scale models must be developed. These targets represent a common ground between what is achievable from the model and retrievable from the remote sensors. This presentation will show precipitation morphology based targets from the Scanning ARM Precipitation Sensitive Radars and and the Weather Forecasting and Research cloud resolving model. Data from a variety of sites will be analyzed using a variety of microphysical schemes and modeling paradigms.},

Research cloud models have been in development over the last 45 years and they continue to be an important tool for investigating clouds, cloud-systems, and other small-scale atmospheric dynamics. The latest generation are now being used for weather prediction. The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model, representative of this generation and of a class of models using explicit time-splitting integration techniques to efficiently integrate the Euler equations, is described in this paper. It is the first fully compressible conservative-form nonhydrostatic atmospheric model suitable for both research and weather prediction applications. Results are presented demonstrating its ability to resolve strongly nonlinear small-scale phenomena, clouds, and cloud systems. Kinetic energy spectra and other statistics show that the model is simulating small scales in numerical weather prediction applications, while necessarily removing energy at the gridscale but minimizing artificial dissipation at the resolved scales. Filtering requirements for atmospheric models and filters used in the ARW model are discussed.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis study investigates the influence of microscale turbulent clustering of cloud droplets on the radar reflectivity factor and proposes a new parameterization to account for it. A three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of particle-laden isotropic turbulence is performed to obtain turbulent clustering data. The clustering data is then used to calculate the power spectra of droplet number density fluctuations, which show a dependence on the Taylor microscale-based Reynolds number ReÎ» and the Stokes number St. First, the Reynolds number dependency of the turbulent clustering influence is investigated for 127 {\textbackslash}textless ReÎ» {\textbackslash}textless 531. The spectra for this wide range of ReÎ» values reveal that ReÎ» = 204 is sufficiently large to be representative of the whole wavenumber range relevant for radar observations of atmospheric clouds. We then investigate the Stokes number dependency for ReÎ» = 204 and propose an empirical model for the turbulent clustering influence assuming power laws for the number density spectrum. For Stokes numbers less than 2, the proposed model can estimate the influence of turbulence on the spectrum with an RMS error less than 1 dB when calculated over the wavenumber range relevant for radar observations. For larger Stokes number droplets, the model estimate has larger errors, but the influence of turbulence is likely negligible in typical clouds. Applications of the proposed model to two idealized cloud observing scenarios reveal that microscale turbulent clustering can cause a significant error in estimating cloud droplet amounts from radar observations with microwave frequencies less than 13.8 GHz.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis study presents radar-based precipitation estimates collected during the two-month DOE ARM - NASA Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E). Emphasis is on the usefulness of radar observations from the C-band and X-band scanning ARM precipitation radars (CSAPR, XSAPR) for rainfall estimation products to distances within 100 km of the Lamont, Oklahoma ARM facility. The study utilizes a dense collection of collocated ARM, NASA-GPM and nearby surface Oklahoma Mesonet gauge records to evaluate radar-based hourly rainfall products and campaign optimized methods over individual gauges and for areal rainfall characterizations. Rainfall products are also evaluated against the performance of a regional NWS WSR-88D S-band dual-polarization radar product. Results indicate that the CSAPR system may achieve similar point and areal-gauge bias and root mean square (rms) error performance to a WSR-88D reference for the variety of MC3E deep convective events sampled. The best campaign rainfall performance was achieved when using radar relations capitalizing on estimates of the specific attenuation from the CSAPR system. The XSAPRs demonstrate limited capabilities, having modest success compared to the WSR-88D reference for hourly rainfall accumulations under 10 mm. All rainfall estimation methods exhibit a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 reduction in rms errors for areal accumulations over a 15 km2 NASA dense gauge network, with the smallest errors typically associated with dual-polarization radar methods.},

A Kalman filter is used to provide smooth estimates of velocity at a pixel through time. Using this technique in combination with the K-Means clusters, we can identify storm motion at different scales and choose different scales to forecast based on the time scale of interest. The motion estimator has been applied both to reflectivity data obtained from the National Weather Service Radar (WSR-88D) and to cloud-top infrared temperatures obtained from GOES satellites. We demonstrate results on both these sensors.},

Because it is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) user facility, ARM data are freely available to anyone through the ARM Data Archive. With 20 years of operations, the facility recently added two mobile facilities and an aerial facility to its network of fixed-location sites. Research using ARM data has led to advances in areas ranging from radiative transfer to cloud microphysics. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allowed ARM to enhance its observational capabilities with a broad array of new instruments at its fixed and mobile sites and the aerial facility. Instruments include scanning radars; water vapor, cloud/aerosol extinction, and Doppler lidars; aerosol instruments for measuring optical, physical, and chemical properties; and aircraft probes for measuring cloud and aerosol properties. Taking full advantage of these instruments will involve the development of complex data products. This work is underway but will benefit from engagement with the broader scientific community. This article describes the current status of the ARM research capabilities with an emphasis on developments over the past eight years since ARM was designated a DOE scientific user facility, reviews some of scientific advances made using the ARM Facility over the past two decades, and describes the new measurement capabilities and adaptations of the ARM facility to make effective use of these capabilities.},

	abstract = {A series of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) was observed in the UK during one of the Intensive Observation Periods (IOP 3) in the Convective Storm Initiation Project (CSIP). A detailed case-study of one of the MCSs, involving some novel interpretation of single Doppler radar data, reveals the evolution of stacked slantwise circulations associated with elevated upright convection. A feature of this occasion was the existence near the surface of a strong undercurrent of cool air flowing against the direction of travel of the storm. The air feeding both the upright and slantwise ascent originated not from near the surface but, rather, from layers between 1 and 3  km. The upright convection was intense at first and was accompanied by a region of dry subsidence surrounding it, together with the alternating layers of slantwise ascent and descent within the storm's precipitation area. When the elevated upright convection weakened, vigorous slantwise motions continued for some time, but their slope decreased from the initial 1 in 4 to 1 in 9. The lowermost layer of slantwise descent corresponded to a moderately intense rear-inflow jet. The rear-inflow jet did not penetrate the cool undercurrent and reach the surface; instead, beneath where it impacted the warm air capping the undercurrent, the undercurrent took on the structure of a gravity wave without stagnation. The raised head of the undercurrent lifted overlying air of high wet-bulb potential temperature sufficiently to overcome the convective inhibition. Copyright Â© 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Climate modelers generally require meteorological information on regular grids, but monitoring stations are, in practice, sited irregularly. Thus, there is a need to produce public data records that interpolate available data to a high density grid, which can then be used to generate meteorological maps at a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition to point predictions, quantifications of uncertainty are also needed. One way to accomplish this is to provide multiple simulations of the relevant meteorological quantities conditional on the observed data taking into account the various uncertainties in predicting a space-time process at locations with no monitoring data. Using a high-quality dataset of minute-by-minute measurements of atmospheric pressure in north-central Oklahoma, this work describes a statistical approach to carrying out these conditional simulations. Based on observations at 11 stations, conditional simulations were produced at two other sites with monitoring stations. The resulting point predictions are very accurate and the multiple simulations produce well-calibrated prediction uncertainties for temporal changes in atmospheric pressure but are substantially overconservative for the uncertainties in the predictions of (undifferenced) pressure.},

	abstract = {Active remote sensors collect complex data sets, which, traditionally, have been further complicated by a lack of community standards. With multiple agencies investing heavily in state of the art sensor technology there is a need to create community standards that enable interoperability across various software suites. The first and easiest approach is a unified file format building on existing community standards. This presentation outlines efforts on the Lidar/Radar Open Source Environment (LROSE) at NCAR and the ARM efforts on the Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) two toolkits, which approach the problem of working with active sensors from two different directions. LROSE is a community software project is to provide to the scientific community with a modern, fully-featured software suite for handling radar, profiler and lidar data. While Pyâ€‘ART uses an abstract python object to allow new modules to be build easily without in-depth knowledge of the data source or internal representation of the data. Current progress will be reported as well as efforts to unify the projects in order to enable end users, not possessing high end programming skills, ease of access to the data.},

	abstract = {Capsule To date, progress in the use of weather radar observations has been impeded by a lack of community-based software development. Recently, though, several Open Source products have demonstrated that OSS can be a real benefit to the radar community. Weather radar analysis has become increasingly sophisticated over the past 50 years, and efforts to keep software up to date have generally lagged behind the needs of the users. We argue that progress has been impeded by the fact that software has not been developed and shared as a community. Recently, the situation has been changing. In this paper, the developers of a number of Open Source Software (OSS) projects highlight the potential of OSS to advance radar-related research. We argue that the community-based development of OSS holds the potential to reduce duplication of efforts, and to create transparency in implemented algorithms while improving the quality and scope of the software. We also conclude that there is sufficiently mature technology to support collaboration across different software projects. This could allow for consolidation towards a set of interoperable software platforms, each designed to accommodate very specific user requirements.},

	abstract = {Weather forecasts started from realistic initial conditions are used to diagnose the large warm and dry bias over the United States Southern Great Plains simulated by the GFDL climate model. The forecasts exhibit biases in surface air temperature and precipitation within 3 days which appear to be similar to the climate bias. With the model simulating realistic evaporation but underestimated precipitation, a deficit in soil moisture results which amplifies the initial temperature bias through feedbacks with the land surface. The underestimate of precipitation may be associated with an inability of the model to simulate the eastward propagation of convection from the front-range of the Rocky Mountains and is insensitive to an increase of horizontal resolution from 2Â° to 0.5Â° latitude.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe aim of this study is to examine the statistics of convective storms and their concomitant changes with thermodynamic variability. The thermodynamic variability is analyzed by performing a cluster analysis on variables derived from radiosonde releases at Brisbane airport. Three objectively defined regimes are found: a dry, stable regime with mainly westerly surface winds, a moist northerly regime and a moist trade wind regime. S-Band radar data is analyzed and storms identified using objective tracking software (TITAN). Storm statistics are then investigated stratified by the regime sub-periods.Convective storms are found to initiate and maintain along elevated topography. Probability distributions of convective storm size and rain rate are found to follow lognormal distributions with differing mean and variance among the regimes. There was some evidence of trimodal storm top heights, located at the trade inversion (1.5â€“2 km), freezing level (3.6â€“4 km) and near 6 km, but it was dependent on the presence of the trade inversion. On average, storm volume and height are smallest in the trade regime and rain rate largest in the westerly regime. However, westerly regime storms occur less frequently and have shorter lifetimes which was attributed to the enhanced stability and decreased humidity profiles. Furthermore, time series of diurnal rain rate exhibited early morning and mid-afternoon maxima for the northerly and trade regimes but were absent for the westerly regime. The observations indicate that westerly regime storms are primarily driven by large scale forcing while northerly and trade wind regime storms are more responsive to surface characteristics.},

	abstract = {The ultimate goal of this study is to improve the representation of convective transport by cumulus parameterization for mesoscale and climate models. As Part 1 of the study, we perform extensive evaluations of cloud-resolving simulations of a squall line and mesoscale convective complexes in midlatitude continent and tropical regions using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with spectral bin microphysics (SBM) and with two double-moment bulk microphysics schemes: a modified Morrison (MOR) and Milbrandt and Yau (MY2). Compared to observations, in general, SBM gives better simulations of precipitation and vertical velocity of convective cores than MOR and MY2 and therefore will be used for analysis of scale dependence of eddy transport in Part 2. The common features of the simulations for all convective systems are (1) the model tends to overestimate convection intensity in the middle and upper troposphere, but SBM can alleviate much of the overestimation and reproduce the observed convection intensity well; (2) the model greatly overestimates Ze in convective cores, especially for the weak updraft velocity; and (3) the model performs better for midlatitude convective systems than the tropical system. The modeled mass fluxes of the midlatitude systems are not sensitive to microphysics schemes but are very sensitive for the tropical case indicating strong microphysics modification to convection. Cloud microphysical measurements of rain, snow, and graupel in convective cores will be critically important to further elucidate issues within cloud microphysics schemes.},

This VM can be run on any operating system, and guarantees reproducibility of results across platforms. It contains a suite of independent OSS weather radar tools (BALTRAD, Py-ART, wradlib, RSL, and Radx), and a scientific Python stack. Furthermore, it features a suite of recipes that work out of the box, and provide guidance on how to use the different OSS tools alone and together. The code to build the VM from source is hosted on GitHub, which allows the VM to grow with its community.We argue that the VM presents another step towards Open (Weather Radar) Science. It can be used as a quick way to get started, for teaching, or for benchmarking and combining different tools. It can foster the idea of reproducible research in scientific publishing. Being scalable and extendable, it might even allow for real-time data processing.We expect the VM to catalyze progress towards interoperability, and to lower the barrier for new users and developers, thus extending the weather radar community and user base.},

	abstract = {Abstract For the purpose of deriving grid-scale vertical velocity and advective tendencies from sounding measurements, an objective scheme is developed to process atmospheric soundings of winds, temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio over a network of a small number of stations. Given the inevitable uncertainties in the original data, state variables of the atmosphere are adjusted by the smallest possible amount in this scheme to conserve column-integrated mass, moisture, static energy, and momentum. The scheme has the capability of incorporating a variety of supplemental measurements to constrain large-scale vertical velocity and advective tendencies derived from state variables. The method has been implemented to process the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Programâ€™s (ARM) soundings of winds, temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio at the boundary facilities around the Cloud and Radiation Testbed site in northern Oklahoma in April 1994. It is found that state variables are adjusted by an amount comparable to their measurement uncertainties to satisfy the conservation requirements of mass, water vapor, heat, and momentum. Without these adjustments, spurious residual sources and sinks in the column budget of each quantity have the same magnitudes as other leading components. Sensitivities of the diagnosed vertical velocity and apparent heat, moisture, and momentum sources to the number of conservation constraints are presented. It is shown that constraints of column budget of moisture and dry static energy can make large differences to these diagnostics, especially when some original sounding data are missing and have to be interpolated. Analysis of the moisture budget shows that large-scale convergence often corresponds to precipitation, but there are occasions when precipitation corresponds to a large reduction of column precipitable water and column-moisture divergence. Analysis of momentum budget shows large magnitudes of subgrid-scale momentum sources and sinks (about 4 m sâˆ’1 hâˆ’1) in the convective events.},

	abstract = {Observations made during the TWP-ICE campaign are used to drive and evaluate thirteen cloud-resolving model simulations with periodic lateral boundary conditions. The simulations employ 2D and 3D dynamics, one- and two-moment microphysics, several variations on large-scale forcing, and the use of observationally derived aerosol properties to prognose droplet numbers. When domain means are averaged over a 6-day active monsoon period, all simulations reproduce observed surface precipitation rate but not its structural distribution. Simulated fractional areas covered by convective and stratiform rain are uncorrelated with one another, and are both variably overpredicted by up to a factor of âˆ¼2. Stratiform area fractions are strongly anticorrelated with outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) but are negligibly correlated with ice water path (IWP), indicating that ice spatial distribution controls OLR more than mean IWP. Overpredictions of OLR tend to be accompanied by underpredictions of reflected shortwave radiation (RSR). When there are two simulations differing only in microphysics scheme or large-scale forcing, the one with smaller stratiform area tends to exhibit greater OLR and lesser RSR by similar amounts. After âˆ¼10 days, simulations reach a suppressed monsoon period with a wide range of mean precipitable water vapor, attributable in part to varying overprediction of cloud-modulated radiative flux divergence compared with observationally derived values. Differences across the simulation ensemble arise from multiple sources, including dynamics, microphysics, and radiation treatments. Close agreement of spatial and temporal averages with observations may not be expected, but the wide spreads of predicted stratiform fraction and anticorrelated OLR indicate a need for more rigorous observation-based evaluation of the underlying micro- and macrophysical properties of convective and stratiform structures.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe scanning Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program cloud radars (SACRs) are the primary instruments for documenting the four-dimensional structure and evolution of clouds within a 20?30-km radius of the ARM fixed and mobile sites. Here, the postprocessing of the calibrated SACR measurements is discussed. First, a feature mask algorithm that objectively determines the presence of significant radar returns is described. The feature mask algorithm is based on the statistical properties of radar receiver noise. It accounts for atmospheric emission and is applicable even for SACR profiles with few or no signal-free range gates. Using the nearest-in-time atmospheric sounding, the SACR radar reflectivities are corrected for gaseous attenuation (water vapor and oxygen) using a line-by-line absorption model. Despite having a high pulse repetition frequency, the SACR has a narrow Nyquist velocity limit and thus Doppler velocity folding is commonly observed. An unfolding algorithm that makes use of a first guess for the true Doppler velocity using horizontal wind measurements from the nearest sounding is described. The retrieval of the horizontal wind profile from the hemispherical sky range?height indicator SACR scan observations and/or nearest sounding is described. The retrieved horizontal wind profile can be used to adaptively configure SACR scan strategies that depend on wind direction. Several remaining challenges are discussed, including the removal of insect and second-trip echoes. The described algorithms significantly enhance SACR data quality and constitute an important step toward the utilization of SACR measurements for cloud research.},

These processes include turbulence, convection, clouds, and radiation. Singleâ€column model (SCM) simulation of idealized cases and the subsequent evaluation against large-eddy simulation (LES) results has become an often used and relied on method to obtain insight at process level into the behavior of such parameterization schemes; benefits of SCM simulation are the enhanced model transparency and the high computational efficiency. Although this approach has achieved demonstrable success, some shortcomings have been identified; among these, i) the statistical significance and relevance of single idealized case studies might be questioned and ii) the use of observational datasets has been relatively limited. A recently initiated project named the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) Parameterization Testbed (KPT) is part of a general move toward a more statistically significant process-level evaluation, with the purpose of optimizing the identification of problems in general circulation models that are related to parameterization schemes. The main strategy of KPT is to apply continuous long-term SCM simulation and LES at various permanent meteorological sites, in combination with comprehensive evaluation against observations at multiple time scales. We argue that this strategy enables the reproduction of typical long-term mean behavior of fast physics in large-scale models, but it still preserves the benefits of single-case studies (such as model transparency). This facilitates the tracing and understanding of errors in parameterization schemes, which should eventually lead to a reduction of related uncertainties in numerical predictions of weather and climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract A theory of the interaction of a cumulus cloud ensemble with the large-scale environment is developed. In this theory, the large-scale environment is divided into the subcloud mixed layer and the region above. The time changes of the environment are governed by the heat and moisture budget equations for the subcloud mixed layer and for the region above, and by a prognostic equation for the depth of the mixed layer. In the environment above the mixed layer, the cumulus convection affects the temperature and moisture fields through cumulus-induced subsidence and detrainment of saturated air containing liquid water which evaporates in the environment. In the subcloud mixed layer, the cumulus convection does not act directly on the temperature and moisture fields, but it affects the depth of the mixed layer through cumulus-induced subsidence. Under these conditions the problem of parameterization of cumulus convection reduces to the determination of the vertical distributions of the total vertical mass flux by the ensemble, the total detrainment of mass from the ensemble, and the thermodynamical properties of the detraining air. The cumulus ensemble is spectrally divided into sub-ensembles according to the fractional entrainment rate, given by the ratio of the entrainment per unit height to the vertical mass flux in the cloud. For these sub-ensembles, the budget equations for mass, moist static energy, and total water content are obtained. The solutions of these equations give the temperature excess, the water vapor excess, and the liquid water content of each sub-ensemble, and further reduce the problem of parameterization to the determination of the mass flux distribution function, which is the sub-ensemble vertical mass flux at the top of the mixed layer. The cloud work function, which is an integral measure of the buoyancy force in the clouds, is defined for each sub-ensemble; and, under the assumption that it is in quasi-equilibrium, an integral equation for the mass flux distribution function is derived. This equation describes how a cumulus ensemble is forced by large-scale advection, radiation, and surface turbulent fluxes, and it provides a closed parameterization of cumulus convection for use in prognostic models of large-scale atmospheric motion.},

The PFs retrieved using this algorithm (which number nearly six million Tropicswide) have been sorted by size and intensity ranging from small shallow features greater than 75 km2 in area to large mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) according to their radar and ice scattering characteristics. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the diurnal cycle of the observed precipitation features' rainfall amount, precipitation feature frequency, rainfall intensity, convectiveâ€“stratiform rainfall portioning, and remotely sensed convective intensity, sampled Tropicswide from space. The observations are sorted regionally to examine the stark differences in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and convective intensity over land and ocean areas. Over the oceans, the diurnal cycle of rainfall has small amplitude, with the maximum contribution to rainfall coming from MCSs in the early morning. This increased contribution is due to an increased number of MCSs in the nighttime hours, not increasing MCS areas or conditional rain rates, in agreement with previous works. Rainfall from sub-MCS features over the ocean has little appreciable diurnal cycle of rainfall or convective intensity. Land areas have a much larger rainfall cycle than over the ocean, with a marked minimum in the midmorning hours and a maximum in the afternoon, slowly decreasing through midnight. Non-MCS features have a significant peak in afternoon instantaneous conditional rain rates (the mean rain rate in raining pixels), and convective intensities, which differs from previous studies using rain rates derived from hourly rain gauges. This is attributed to enhancement by afternoon heating. MCSs over land have a convective intensity peak in the late afternoon, however all land regions have MCS rainfall peaks that occur in the late evening through midnight due to their longer life cycle. The diurnal cycle of overland MCS rainfall and convective intensity varies significantly among land regions, attributed to MCS sensitivity to the varying environmental conditions in which they occur.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study examines the doubleâ€“intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) problem in the coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The twentieth-century climate simulations of 22 IPCC AR4 CGCMs are analyzed, together with the available Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) runs from 12 of them. To understand the physical mechanisms for the double-ITCZ problem, the main oceanâ€“atmosphere feedbacks, including the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradientâ€“trade wind feedback (or Bjerknes feedback), the SSTâ€“surface latent heat flux (LHF) feedback, and the SSTâ€“surface shortwave flux (SWF) feedback, are studied in detail. The results show that most of the current state-of-the-art CGCMs have some degree of the double-ITCZ problem, which is characterized by excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics (e.g., Northern Hemisphere ITCZ, South Pacific convergence zone, Maritime Continent, and equatorial Indian Ocean), and are often associated with insufficient precipitation over the equatorial Pacific. The excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics usually causes overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF, and insufficient SWF, leading to significant cold SST bias in much of the tropical oceans. Most of the models also simulate insufficient latitudinal asymmetry in precipitation and SST over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The AMIP runs also produce excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics, including the equatorial Pacific, which also leads to overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF, and insufficient SWF. This suggests that the excessive tropical precipitation is an intrinsic error of the atmospheric models, and that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in the coupled runs of many models comes from oceanâ€“atmosphere feedback. Feedback analysis demonstrates that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in different models is associated with one or more of the following three biases in oceanâ€“atmosphere feedback over the equatorial Pacific: 1) excessive Bjerknes feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of precipitation to SST and overly strong time-mean surface wind speed; 2) overly positive SSTâ€“LHF feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of surface air humidity to SST; and 3) insufficient SSTâ€“SWF feedback, which is caused by insufficient sensitivity of cloud amount to precipitation. Off the equator over the eastern Pacific stratus region, most of the models produce insufficient stratusâ€“SST feedback associated with insufficient sensitivity of stratus cloud amount to SST, which may contribute to the insufficient latitudinal asymmetry of SST in their coupled runs. These results suggest that the double-ITCZ problem in CGCMs may be alleviated by reducing the excessive tropical precipitation and the above feedback-relevant errors in the atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper documents the development of a novel approach for representing ice microphysics in numerical models. In this approach, the ice particle massâ€“dimension and projected-areaâ€“dimension relationships vary as a function of particle size and rimed mass fraction. All ice microphysical processes and parameters are calculated in a self-consistent manner in terms of these massâ€“dimension and areaâ€“dimension relationships. The rimed mass fraction is predicted locally by separately predicting the ice mixing ratios acquired through water vapor deposition and through riming. The third predicted variable is the number concentration of ice particles. This approach allows representing in a natural way the gradual transition from small to large ice particles due to growth by water vapor deposition and aggregation and from unrimed crystals to graupel due to riming. In traditional approaches, these processes are treated by separating ice particles into predefined categories (such as cloud ice, snow, and graupel) using fairly arbitrary thresholds and conversion rates. With some modifications, the new approach can be employed in either bin or bulk microphysical models. In this paper, the new approach is implemented in a bulk two-moment microphysical scheme representing both warm-rain and ice processes and it is applied to an idealized 2D kinematic framework mimicking a shallow mixed-phase cumulus. The size distributions of cloud droplets, drizzle/rain drops, and ice particles are represented using gamma distributions. The new scheme is compared to a version of the scheme that uses the traditional approach for ice microphysics; that is, unrimed ice/snow and graupel are separate species, with threshold-based conversion rates between the former and the latter. The new and traditional schemes produce similar results, although the traditional scheme, unlike the new scheme, produces a distinct double maximum in the surface precipitation rate, corresponding to precipitation shafts consisting of either ice/snow or graupel. The relative magnitude of these peaks, as well as the ice water path and optical depth of the simulated cloud, is highly sensitive to the threshold for converting unrimed ice to graupel. In contrast, the new scheme does not require any conversion threshold and predicts formation of ice particles with wide range of rimed fractions.},

	abstract = {Previous observational studies have identified three different types of diurnal precipitation variation over the conterminous U.S.: localized afternoon rainfall maxima over the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, propagating mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) from the Rocky Mountain region, and propagating MCSs over the Appalachian Mountains. This study focuses on the second type, which involves nocturnal rainfall maxima from eastward-propagating MCSs on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains. This study evaluates model simulations with regard to rainfall using observations and assesses the impact of microphysics, surface fluxes, radiation, and terrain on the simulated diurnal rainfall variation. A regional high-resolution model was used to conduct a series of real-time forecasts during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) in 2011 over the Southern Great Plains. The model ably captured most heavy precipitation events. When all forecast days are composited, the mean forecast depicts accurate, propagating precipitation features and thus the overall diurnal variation. However, individual forecasts tend to overestimate the rainfall for light precipitation events, have location errors, and misrepresent convection in some cases. A post mission case study is performed on one multi-cell, eastward-propagating MCS event; the results suggest that cold-pool dynamics were an important physical process. Model results also indicate that terrain effects are important during the initial stages of MCS development. By increasing the terrain height by 10\%, the simulated rainfall is increased and in better agreement with observations. On the other hand, surface fluxes, and radiation processes only have a secondary effect for short-term simulations.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn a recent BAMS article, it is argued that community-based Open Source Software (OSS) could foster scientific progress in weather radar research, and make weather radar software more affordable, flexible, transparent, sustainable, and interoperable.Nevertheless, it can be challenging for potential developers and users to realize these benefits: tools are often cumbersome to install; different operating systems may have particular issues, or may not be supported at all; and many tools have steep learning curves.In order to overcome some of these barriers, we present an open, community-based virtual machine (VM). This VM can be run on any operating system, and guarantees reproducibility of results across platforms. It contains a suite of independent OSS weather radar tools (BALTRAD, Py-ART, wradlib, RSL, and Radx), and a scientific Python stack. Furthermore, it features a suite of recipes that work out of the box, and provide guidance on how to use the different OSS tools alone and together. The code to build the VM from source is hosted on GitHub, which allows the VM to grow with its community.We argue that the VM presents another step towards Open (Weather Radar) Science. It can be used as a quick way to get started, for teaching, or for benchmarking and combining different tools. It can foster the idea of reproducible research in scientific publishing. Being scalable and extendable, it might even allow for real-time data processing.We expect the VM to catalyze progress towards interoperability, and to lower the barrier for new users and developers, thus extending the weather radar community and user base.},

This high-bias results from ice water content being large, which is a product of large, strong convective updrafts, although hydrometeor size distribution assumptions modulate the size of this bias. Making snow mass more realistically proportional to D2 rather than D3 eliminates unrealistically large snow reflectivities over 40 dBZ in some simulations. Graupel, unlike snow, produces high biased reflectivity in all simulations, which is partly a result of parameterized microphysics but also partly a result of overly intense simulated updrafts. Peak vertical velocities in deep convective updrafts are greater than dual-Doppler-retrieved values, especially in the upper troposphere. Freezing of liquid condensate, often rain, lofted above the freezing level in simulated updraft cores greatly contributes to these excessive upper tropospheric vertical velocities. The strongest simulated updraft cores are nearly undiluted, with some of the strongest showing supercell characteristics during the multicellular (presquall) stage of the event. Decreasing horizontal grid spacing from 900 to 100 m slightly weakens deep updraft vertical velocity and moderately decreases the amount of condensate aloft but not enough to match observational retrievals. Therefore, overly intense simulated updrafts may additionally be a product of unrealistic interactions between convective dynamics, parameterized microphysics, and large-scale model forcing that promote different convective strengths than observed.},

This paper describes an objective approach based on cluster analysis to deriving the PDFs. An iterative procedure with K-means clustering and expectation?maximization clustering based on Gaussian mixture models is developed to generate a series of prototypes for each hydrometeor type from several radar scans. The prototypes are then grouped together to produce a PDF for each hydrometeor type, which is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. The cluster-based method is applied to polarimetric radar data collected with the CP-2 S-band radar near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The results are illustrated and compared with theoretical classification boundaries in the literature. Some notable differences are found. Automated hydrometeor classification algorithms can be built using the PDFs of polarimetric variables associated with each hydrometeor type presented in this paper.},
